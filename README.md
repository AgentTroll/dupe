# `dupe`

I've never actually written Python in my entire life
before, but this is just a little script I tried
writing to find duplicate words from a list of words pasted
into a file. Nothing special, but I guess I can say that
I'm pretty proud of it, since it's my first Python script
and all.

# Usage

Requires Python3.

```
git clone https://github.com/AgentTroll/dupe.git
cd dupe
python dupe.py [filepath]
```
